# Brief description about Network Shares

 In computing, a shared resource, or network share, is a computer resource made available from one host 
to other hosts on a computer network.It is a device or piece of information on a computer that can be remotely
accessed from another computer, typically via a local area network or an enterprise intranet, transparently as if 
it were a resource in the local machine. Network sharing is made possible by inter-process communication over the network.
Some examples of shareable resources are computer programs, data, storage devices, and printers. E.g. shared file access
(also known as disk sharing and folder sharing), shared printer access, shared scanner access, etc. The shared resource
is called a shared disk, shared folder or shared document.
